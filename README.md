# Peanut fungal inoculation
In this study, we screened fungi for salinity and high temperature with the objective of obtaining tolerant fungi. the fungi were P. citrinum, Mortierella calciphila, M. alpina, and Linnemannia elongata. these fungi were then inoculated into peanut seedlings and tested the response in the peanut plant under well-water conditions and drought (water restriction).

Here is where we screened the fungal isolates to salinity and temperatures.
# [Biomass assay](https://github.com/lauraRodriiguez/PGPFpeanut/blob/main/02_BiomassAssay.Rmd)
Some of the fungal cultures had a sporulated growth in the media plate, hence, we decided to do a biomass assay to ensure the growth in salinity and high temperature.

In this experiment, we tested the fungal isolates and peanuts under no water stress. Measurements taken were shoot and root dry biomass, Phi2, and root tip inoculation (re-isolation).

Implementation of drought (water stress) to peanut seedlings inoculated with fungi. Measurements taken were rating scale, Phi2, and shoot and root dry biomass.
# [Fungal inoculation of peanut under water stress (20% of soil water content) in the growth chamber](https://github.com/lauraRodriiguez/PGPFpeanut/blob/main/05_WaterRestrictionGrowthChamber.Rmd)
Peanuts inoculated with fungi under 20% of soil water content in the growth chamber.
